E-commerce Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the work I completed for Task 2 of my Data Science internship at SkillCraft Technology. The objective of this task was to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the E-commerce dataset using Power BI, exploring relationships between variables and identifying patterns and trends in the data.

Key Steps

1.Data Cleaning

Prepared the dataset within Power BI, handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.

2.Data Visualization

Built interactive dashboards to analyze customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.

Used visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to derive insights.

3.Tools Used

Power BI for data cleaning, visualization, and dashboard creation.

4.Key Insights

Customer Segments: Identified high-value customers based on spending patterns.

Popular Products: Highlighted top product categories and their contribution to revenue.

Seasonal Trends: Discovered purchase spikes during specific times of the year.
